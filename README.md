## Technical Details

### Extraction Process

Questions were extracted from PDF files using PyMuPDF (fitz), which preserves:
- **Bold text**: Typically used for answers and key terms
- **Italic text**: Used for book/movie titles and foreign terms
- **Underlined text**: Used for pronunciation guides

The extraction script (`extract_questions.py`):
1. Reads all PDF files in the directory
2. Categorizes questions by difficulty based on filename keywords:
   - "championship" → National Championships
   - "semifinal" → Semifinals
   - "quarterfinal" → Quarterfinals
   - "finals" → Finals
   - Everything else → Preliminary
3. Removes headers, page numbers, and metadata
4. Extracts question-answer pairs with HTML formatting
5. Saves to `questions.json` for fast loading

### Web Application

Built with vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript for maximum compatibility:
- **No dependencies**: Pure JavaScript, works offline
- **Fast loading**: Questions pre-processed and stored in JSON
- **Smooth streaming**: Configurable character-by-character display
- **Responsive design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
